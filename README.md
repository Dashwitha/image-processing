# image-processing
## 1. Develop a program to display gray scale image using read and write operation.
### Grayscale Images:
Grayscale is a range of monochromatic shades from black to white. Therefore, a grayscale image contains only shades of gray and no color.While digital images can be saved as grayscale (or black and white) images, even color images contain grayscale information. This is because each pixel has a luminance value, regardless of its color. Luminance can also be described as brightness or intensity, which can be measured on a scale from black (zero intensity) to white (full intensity).Many image editing programs allow you to convert a color image to black and white, or grayscale. This process removes all color information, leaving only the luminance of each pixel.
###code
import cv2
imgclr=cv2.imread("imgred.jpg",1)
imggry = cv2.cvtColor(imgclr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
cv2.imshow('imagecolor',imgclr)
cv2.imshow('imagecolor1',imggry)
cv2.imwrite('grayimg.jpg',imggry)
cv2.waitKey()

## output:

## 2. Develop a program to perform linear transformation on an image.
### linear transformation
Piece-wise Linear Transformation is type of gray level transformation that is used for image enhancement. It is a spatial domain method. It is used for manipulation of an image so that the result is more suitable than the original for a specific application.
#### a)Scaling
In computer graphics and digital imaging, image scaling refers to the resizing of a digital image. ... When scaling a raster graphics image, a new image with a higher or lower number of pixels must be generated. In the case of decreasing the pixel number (scaling down) this usually results in a visible quality loss.
###code
import cv2 
imgclr=cv2.imread("imgred.jpg") 
res = cv2.resize(imgclr,(300,300),interpolation=cv2.INTER_CUBIC) 
cv2.imshow('imagecolor',imgclr)
cv2.imshow('imagecolor1',res)
cv2.waitKey()


## output:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72288132/104897222-21b2c180-599e-11eb-91dd-7416e97d4451.png)   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72288132/104897435-5fafe580-599e-11eb-9c96-b4bd35858b3c.png)  
 
 ## b)Rotation
 Image rotation is a common image processing routine with applications in matching, alignment, and other image-based algorithms. ... An image rotated by 45Â°. The output is the same size as the input, and the out of edge values are dropped.
 ###code
 import cv2 
imgclr=cv2.imread("colorimg.jpg") 
(row, col) = imgclr.shape[:2] 
M = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((col / 2, row/ 2), 45, 1)
res = cv2.warpAffine(imgclr, M, (col,row)) 
cv2.imshow('imagecolor',imgclr)
cv2.imshow('imagecolor1',res)
cv2.waitKey()
## output:

 ## 3.Develop a program to find the sum and mean of a set of images
 In digital image processing, the sum of absolute differences (SAD) is a measure of the similarity between image blocks. It is calculated by taking the absolute difference between each pixel in the original block and the corresponding pixel in the block being used for comparison. These differences are summed to create a simple metric of block similarity, the L1 norm of the difference image or Manhattan distance between two image blocks.
 ####code
sum and mean
import cv2
import glob 
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
path=glob.glob("E:\pics\*.jpg")
for file in path:
    print(file)
    image=cv2.imread(file)
    sum=image+sum
mean=sum/20
cv2.imshow("Sum",sum)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.imshow("Mean",mean)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
